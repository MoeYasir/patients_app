Project 


For decades we've been suffering from unjustified death because of the lack of medical attention and poor healthcare services. So it was a great idea to devote research to those crucial issues.

Checking available hospitals, ICUs, medication, staff, and ambulances would save people’s lives, time, effort, and even money. And that is exactly what we built, and even more.

-We provide our patients with the ability for checking the availability of all they need.

-You can make quick help for urgent needs and it will directly show you the nearest available hospital with ambulance service.

-It’s also straightforward to book appointments in the hospital and choose which specialist you wanna see.

-Our priority is our patients so it will make sense to provide them with private ambulances due to the slow response of public ones.

-To make it easy and effortlessy they can follow up with doctors without the need for physical meetings.
